/**
 * \brief aggregate IP/TCP/UDP functionality to existing Nodes.
 *
 * This helper enables pcap and ascii tracing of events in the internet stack
 * associated with a node.  This is substantially similar to the tracing
 * that happens in device helpers, but the important difference is that, well,
 * there is no device.  This means that the creation of output file names will
 * change, and also the user-visible methods will not reference devices and
 * therefore the number of trace enable methods is reduced.
 *
 * Normally we avoid multiple inheritance in ns-3, however, the classes 
 * PcapUserHelperForIpv4 and AsciiTraceUserHelperForIpv4 are
 * treated as "mixins".  A mixin is a self-contained class that
 * encapsulates a general attribute or a set of functionality that
 * may be of interest to many other classes.
 *
 * This class aggregates instances of these objects, by default, to each node:
 *  - ns3::ArpL3Protocol
 *  - ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol
 *  - ns3::Icmpv4L4Protocol
 *  - ns3::UdpL4Protocol
 *  - a TCP based on the TCP factory provided
 *  - a PacketSocketFactory
 *  - Ipv4 routing (a list routing object and a static routing object)
